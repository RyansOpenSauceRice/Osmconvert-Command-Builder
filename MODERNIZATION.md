## 🔧 File Structure

- `osmconvert-modern.html` - New modernized version
- `osm-convert-command-generator 8.html` - Updated original file
- `osm-convert-generator 6.html` - Legacy version (unchanged)

## 🚀 Performance Features

### Large File Handling
The modernized version specifically addresses the issue with large files:

- **Before**: Clicking on a 100GB file would attempt to load the entire file content
- **After**: Only the filename is used, preventing memory issues and browser crashes

### Code Implementation
```javascript
// Only use filename, not file content
const fileNames = Array.from(inputFiles).map(file => file.name).join(' ');
command += ` ${fileNames}`;
```

## 🎯 Features

### Input Options
- Multiple file selection with visual feedback
- Support for all OSM formats (.osm, .osc, .osh, .o5m, .o5c, .pbf)
- Polygon file support (.poly, .osm)

### Output Configuration
- Format selection with descriptions
- Custom output filename
- Real-time command preview

### Geographical Filters
- Bounding box with coordinate validation
- Border polygon file selection
- Complete ways and multipolygon options

### Data Modification
- Author/version information removal
- Tag modification with multi-line support
- Advanced memory and object limits

### Advanced Options
- Hash memory configuration (100MB - 10GB)
- Max objects limit (1K - 100M)
- Verbose mode toggle

## 🌟 Design Inspiration

The new design takes inspiration from the [Reddit RSS URL Generator](https://github.com/RyansOpenSauceRice/a-reddit-rss-url-gen) while maintaining the OSM color scheme and adding features specific to OSMConvert.

## 🔄 Migration

Both the original and modernized versions are available:
- Use `osmconvert-modern.html` for the new experience
- The original file has been updated with the modern design
- Legacy version remains available for compatibility

## 🎨 Color Palette

```css
/* Primary OSM Colors */
--osm-blue: #2E86AB;
--osm-purple: #A23B72;
--osm-green: #7CB342;
--osm-light-green: #4CAF50;

/* Gradients */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2E86AB 0%, #A23B72 50%, #7CB342 100%);
```

The modernization maintains full functionality while providing a significantly improved user experience and addressing performance issues with large files.
